<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's a little bird.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are they trying to<__>build a nest?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year, they<__>lay their eggs on the roof<__>of our house.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love<__>to see that moment.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sure you'll see them leave<__>the nest again this year, so<__>come by and check it out.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,<__>but today it's two.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male<__>builds the nest first in order<__>to invite the mate.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so you're the<__>proactive type.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl with<__>funny things to say.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled<__>upon <Dalis>' house.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're<__>both strange kids.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>,<__>that bird is<__>still a newlywed.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say <Stahn>. We are<__>still more than those birds<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only<__>one bird today.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift<__>change time, huh?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delivery?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did you see that?<__>There's an egg!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I did see two eggs,<__>so they are twins.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was moved<__>by it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I hope he's<__>born soon.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the chicks were born.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were born well, even though<__>the world is like this.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there<__>two eggs?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg didn't make it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least this remaining<__>chick bird will leave the nest<__>in the fryer.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for you to<__>leave the nest.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving<__>the nest!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've successfully<__>left the nest.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well, where's<__>the parent bird?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you coming with us?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
After this, the parent birds<__>disappear together. And<__>they die together.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess<__> when you finish raising a child, that<__>ends your role.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such as...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But even the child who has just<__>left the nest will die the same way<__>next year.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pawn Shop Owner<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how the future<__>will be made.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and<__>create the future. I wonder if<__>that's what our role is.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something<__>in the nest.<00>

But everything seems so grand...<__>there are all those big houses<__>and stuff.<00>

It's not backwoods! It's Lienea!<__>In Fitzgald!<00>

Yeah, well. It's got fresh air<__>and the people are friendly. ItÅfs<__>a great town okay??<00>

So you admit it, it is backwoods!<00>

Village Woman<00>

I want to go to a guy named Walt's<__>house. Do you know where that is?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, are you all<__>guests of that guy?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The biggest house in town.<__>That's where he lives.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm wondering, what kinda<__>guy this Walt is, based on her<__>whole demeanor just now.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, at any rate, letÅfs head<__>towards the biggest house in town.<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
How in the world did<__>I get into this?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>, this is your doing!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
IÅfve heard about the way you handle<__>your business practices. I have<__>a duty to the good people<__>of this town.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can handle the arrest of the<__>thief from here. Thank you for<__>cooperating with us.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, for the matter<__>of the cash reward...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Walt you bastard! Selling me<__>out for a quick buck?!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Business practices... Are they<__>saying youÅfre a criminal?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I donÅft know anything<__>about that!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> is no criminal. I can<__>guarantee that as her partner.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The worst she does is threaten<__>shop owners for raising their<__>prices when sheÅfs exchanging lens.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that definitely a crime?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-but! You usually shouldn't arrest<__>someone over something<__>like that, right?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't even know what<__>this is about. Aren't you making<__>some kind of mistake here?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonÅft allow you to be a<__>disturbance. Detain her!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of getting all up in arms,<__>letÅfs talk this out first.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
WhatÅfs with this pretentious attitude? Know your place!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
If thatÅfs what you want, fine!<__>Arrest 'em all! Out of the way!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking now?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You bastard...!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
ÅHÅHÅH<00>

How pathetic, I<__>can't watch<__>anymore.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Move aside. I'll handle this.<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am <Lion> Magnus,<__>Hedge Knight of the<__>Kingdom of Seinegald.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two Swordians, huh? That's convenient.<__>I'll be taking them both back with me.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just try it!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, I don't mind using force.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to try<__>fighting a fellow Swordian Master.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Are you ok!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, <Rutee>!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch. Idiots.<__>Drag these unconscious fools<__>back to Darilsheid.<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, if it isn't<__>Mr. Hedge Knight, himself!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
My, you certainly hurried<__>here as fast as your little legs<__>could carry you, eh?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would run into someone like this...<__>Right after what <Marian> told me, too...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Remember what's expected of you,<__>someone of your rank."<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You haven't forgotten,<__>have you, Master Leon?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Of course not.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young master, please restrain yourself.<__>You have more important things to do right now.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need you to tell me that,<__>I know.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, please tell me<__>what the current situation is.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just a few moments ago, <__>the criminals came out of the Inn.<__>Our most elite troops were waiting and<__>immediately surrounded them.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, doesn't look like we need our<__>mighty Hedge Knight after all, huh?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't seem to know<__>what you're talking about.<__>Maybe you've got the wrong person?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be charged with<__>obstruction of justice if<__>you don't move aside at once!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there's no need to get violent!<__>Let's talk about this, first.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll not tolerate that<__>arrogant attitude of yours!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
(So that's <Rutee> Katrea<__>...and that Swordian too..)<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear a voice...That's definitely <Atwight>.<__>...Huh? <Dymlos> is here too!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?<__>Is there really another Swordian here?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohhh noooo...I've never been fond of him...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...so there are two Swordians..<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way...!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. I see our "Elite Troops"<__>are really earning their gald, today.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, you've got it wrong!<__>They're just..waiting<__>for their chance to strike!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I'm sure they just<__>need a little time to nap<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the fact remains that they were all<__>knocked out by a mere three people.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take it from here.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking, now?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you..!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pathetic display.<__>I can't watch this anymore.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You go on ahead as well.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes sir. I'll be off, now.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea, huh.<__>She definitely resembled me..<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to admit, I'm relieved...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

I don't know what I would have done<__>if I couldn't bring myself to fight her...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal, what's wrong?<__>You've been silent for a while, now.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughhh, you bet I have.<__>We just fought against <Dymlos>!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that,<__>we beat up his new Master, as well!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea what<__>I'm going to say<__>to them after this...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
????<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, do you have a moment?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who<__>are you supposed to be?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can call me <Walt><__>Consider me a...<__>representative of Harmentz<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough about me, though.<__>You're quite strong, aren't you?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must be, to have bested<__>the Witch of Greed, <Rutee><__>like that.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you must be a knight<__>of great renown, but I...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to know my name.<__>Your business.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
State your business with me.<__>If you have none, then get<__>out of my sight.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! W-Well, you see...<__>It's just that...I haven't<__>received the bounty for<__>those criminals, yet...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. You're the one<__>who tipped us off.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry.<__>An envoy with your money<__>will visit you soon enough.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, I see!<__>W-Well then, if you will excuse me...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, what's wrong?<__>You lost your cool for a moment, there.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
For some time, I've been surrounded<__>by people who only want to butter me up.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm completely fed up with it.<__>You should know this by now, Chal.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's certainly how it's been...<__>Still, for you to treat him so coldly...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever.<__>Our mission is complete. Let's head<__>back to Darilsheid.<00>
