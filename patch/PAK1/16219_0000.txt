...Hahh...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been sighing like that for a while now.<__>It's kind of annoying, Chal.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But Young Master!<__>You don't understand what I've been through!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dymlos and Atwight...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
For the longest time, those two would stick together<__>and worry about one another...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever Atwight was in trouble,<__>Dymlos would come running out of nowhere to help!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atwight, as if by instinct,<__>would always cover Dymlos from afar!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you've got me, someone who's used<__>to being up front or in the rear...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Caught right in the middle of those two lovebirds,<__>who had no idea how obvious they were being!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
They'd stop in the middle of battle,<__>just to gaze at each other, and I, who had to pretend<__>not to notice, got stuck doing ALL THE FIGHTING!!!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Gimme a break, already!!!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
..I..I see...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
....Indeed, you do.<0_0>
