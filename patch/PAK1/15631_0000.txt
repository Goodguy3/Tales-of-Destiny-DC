<Stahn>, do you cook for yourself?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
My sister does most of the housework,<__>so I don't usually do it, but....<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh yeah, I remember once when my family<__>fell asleep, I made porridge.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a good thing you did.<__>That must have made you very happy.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. But I was happy when I was told<__>that I didn't have to do it again.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
They said they would kill me if I did it<__>again. That's an exaggeration, right?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Are you serious?<0_0>
